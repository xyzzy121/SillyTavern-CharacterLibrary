# SillyTavern Character Library

A powerful SillyTavern extension for discovering, organizing, and managing your character library with a modern glassmorphic interface.

> **Note:** This is a hobby project but things mostly work. Expect bugs, use at your own risk.

**7.3.4 Datacat update:** fixes lorebook preservation and variant enrichment, search/NSFW filter changes, Following refresh races, and avatar restore checks. Malformed detail/feed responses are rejected, and retrieval history requires evidence of completion. Live API checks and desktop/mobile browser fixtures passed; human verification remains a live-test limitation. The bundled helper remains **1.13.1**; update and restart SillyTavern if running an older helper. Update the optional Datacat companion to **1.0.2** for its PNG memory-limit fix. See the [Datacat validation record](tests/datacat/README.md) and [whole-extension regression record](tests/README.md).

### 🎨 Character Details

Click any character for a **rich tabbed interface**:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Details** | Rich markdown/HTML/CSS rendering in a secure sandboxed iframe, embedded images, creator notes, alternate greetings, embedded lorebooks |
| **Edit** | Full character card editor with change tracking and visual diff preview |
| **Chats** | All conversations with message counts; resume any chat directly |
| **Gallery** | Images (PNG/JPG/WebP/GIF), video, and audio (MP3/WAV/OGG/M4A) with built-in players. Download embedded media and provider galleries |
| **Related** | Smart recommendations based on shared tags, creator, and content keywords |
| **Versions** | Local snapshots and remote version history with diff preview (shown when history exists) |
| **Info** | Debug/metadata panel for power users (enable in Settings) |

**Detail modal UX:**

- **Edit Lock** prevents accidental changes. The Edit tab opens locked; click **Unlock Editing** to enable field changes
- **Prev/Next navigation** lets you cycle through the current sort + filter view without returning to the grid. Desktop shows chevron buttons on the sides of the modal; mobile swipes left/right on the modal header. Toggle via Settings, **Card Grid & Browse → Prev/Next navigation in character details** (on by default)
- **Unsaved-edits confirmation** when you close the modal or navigate to another character with pending edits in the Edit tab. Save success and programmatic closes (e.g. after delete) skip the prompt
- **Tap-to-scroll on long titles** (mobile): tap a long character name in the modal header or chat preview title to scroll through the full text

## 🖥️ Display Modes

Character Library can run in two modes, configurable in SillyTavern's **Extensions** panel under **Character Library**:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **New Tab** (default) | Opens in a separate browser tab. |
| **Embedded Panel** | Runs inside SillyTavern as an overlay panel. |

### Launcher

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Show launcher dropdown on Characters button** | Off | When off, a separate Character Library icon is added to SillyTavern's top bar and the Characters button behaves normally. When on, the Characters button is hijacked: clicking it opens a small dropdown to choose between SillyTavern's native character manager and Character Library. |

### Embedded Panel Settings

These options apply when Embedded Panel mode is selected:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Launch on startup** | Off | Automatically open the embedded panel when SillyTavern loads. |
| **Show SillyTavern top bar** | On | Keep SillyTavern's top navigation bar visible above the panel. When off, the panel takes the full viewport height. A "Back" button inside the panel returns you to your chat. |
| **Exclusive panels** | On | When enabled, opening the embedded panel closes any open SillyTavern drawers, and opening an ST drawer closes the panel. Prevents panels from overlapping. |

## 🔧 Feature Details

<details open>
<summary><h3>🖼️ Media Management</h3></summary>

- **Gallery tab** for all character images, video, and audio in one place
- **Embedded media downloads** for images linked in creator notes, descriptions, and greetings
- **External image-host extractors** for content embedded as gallery/album links (not direct image URLs). Supports Civitai, Imgchest, Mega, Pixiv, PostImg, Imgbox, ImgBB, Catbox, Dropbox, and Google Drive. The library walks each link, resolves the actual image URLs, and downloads them into the gallery folder. Pixiv and Dropbox require the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected); the rest work without it
- **Provider gallery downloads** from linked characters on ChubAI, Wyvern, or Pygmalion
- **Audio & video support** including MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A with built-in player; video thumbnails with inline playback
- **Full-screen viewer** with keyboard navigation (← → 0 Esc) and scroll-wheel zoom up to 5× with drag-to-pan
- **Bulk localization** across your whole library from Settings, with progress tracking, abort, and history
- **Optional provider gallery** inclusion in bulk localization
- **Background media downloads** (opt-in): set **When an import has extra media** to **Download in the background** (**Settings → Media → Options**) and imports finish immediately while embedded media and gallery downloads run quietly, one character at a time, in a background queue. Track progress in the **notifications bell** in the topbar (**⋮ menu → Notifications** on mobile): live per-character progress, cancel, retry for failed jobs, and a clear-finished button. The queue survives page reloads and resumes automatically
- **Grid card thumbnails** (opt-in) to cut decode cost and bandwidth on the characters grid. Enable in **Settings → Character Library → Grid Card Thumbnails**. By default thumbnails are served in the mobile layout only; toggle "Also use on desktop" to extend coverage. With the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected) installed, cl-helper resizes via jimp and caches each thumbnail on disk at a configurable size (384 / 512 / 640 / 768px wide). Without cl-helper, ST's built-in `/thumbnail` endpoint is used (fixed 96x144, can look blurry on high-DPR screens). Two cache management buttons: **Populate at current size** pre-generates a thumbnail for every character (skipping already-cached) and **Purge cache** deletes every cached thumbnail. The detail modal and gallery always use the full-resolution image

> **Civitai API key** (optional): Required only for private or hidden Civitai posts. Public content extracts without a key. Configure in **Settings → Online → Civitai API Key**. Generate one at [civitai.com/user/account](https://civitai.com/user/account). Using a key requires the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected) (it attaches the key server-side); keyless public extraction works without it.

> **Imgchest password-protected posts**: Card creators usually paste the password somewhere in the card text (creator's notes). The extractor scans these with a regex (matching common patterns like `password: ...`, `pw=...`, `pass is ...`) and submits it automatically. Authentication runs through the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected); without cl-helper, only public posts are extractable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>✏️ Character Creator</h3></summary>

Create new characters from scratch or edit existing ones with an AI-powered assistant built into the library.

#### AI Studio

Each card field (description, personality, scenario, first message, etc.) has a wand icon button that opens the **AI Studio** panel. Inside:

- **Multi-turn conversation**: Chat with the LLM to iteratively refine the field. Ask for rewrites, adjustments, or entirely new content before applying
- **Suggestion chips**: Quick-start prompts that appear per field (e.g. "Write a mysterious backstory", "Make them sarcastic and witty"). Click one to generate immediately
- **Word target**: Set a target word count for generations using the number input. The LLM will aim to match it
- **Undo / Redo**: History stack for the current studio session. Use the toolbar buttons or `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`. Opening a different field starts a fresh history
- **Brainstorm mode**: Generate description text from scratch using only the character's existing metadata as context
- **Apply to card**: When satisfied, click Apply to Card to write the generated text into the card field

#### Highlight Revision

Select (highlight) any portion of text in the AI Studio content area. The studio locks the selection, highlights it visually, and switches to **revision mode**: your next prompt targets only the highlighted section. The LLM rewrites just that segment and splices it back into the surrounding text automatically. Clear the selection to return to full-field mode.

#### Custom System Prompts & Presets

Each field has a **Settings** panel (gear icon) where you can:

- **Override the system prompt**: Replace the built-in instruction for that field with your own
- **Toggle context inclusion**: Choose which other card fields are sent as context when generating (e.g. exclude personality when generating a description)
- **Save presets**: Save your custom prompt as a named preset, load it later, or delete it. Presets are saved per-field and persist across sessions

A dot indicator appears on the gear icon when a field has active overrides.

#### Connection Profiles

If you have multiple Chat Completion sources configured in SillyTavern, a **Connection Profile** dropdown appears in the sidebar under AI Assist. This lets you use a different model for character creation than your chat model.

#### Import from Library

Click **Import from Library** to load an existing character's data into the creator form. This fully hydrates the character (fetching all card fields) and populates every form field including tags, avatar, alternate greetings, and lorebook. You can then modify and save as a new character or overwrite the original.

#### Save Modes

- **Create Character**: Saves as a brand-new character in your library
- **Save as Existing**: When you imported from library, this option appears. Opens a stacked diff review (old on top, new below) showing exactly what changed before overwriting the original card. An automatic snapshot is saved before the overwrite so you can always undo

#### Other Features

- **Creator's Notes**: Live preview with zoom and resize controls, supporting rich HTML/CSS content
- **Avatar**: Upload from file, or import from the library character's existing avatar
- **Field expand/collapse**: Toggle all text fields between compact and expanded view
- **AI tag suggestions**: Generate relevant tags from the character's existing card fields

Access via the **⋮ menu** → **Create a Character**.

<details>
<summary><h3>🎴 On-the-Fly Media Localization</h3></summary>

Many character cards embed images from external hosts (Imgur, Catbox, etc.) which can be slow, unreliable, or go offline. Media Localization downloads these images locally and swaps the URLs **at display time only**. Your original character cards are never modified.

1. Download embedded media via the **Gallery tab** → **"Download Embedded Media"**
2. Enable **"Media Localization"** in Settings (globally or per-character)
3. Remote URLs are transparently replaced with local copies in:
   - Character Library detail views (creator notes, greetings, descriptions)
   - **SillyTavern chat messages and Creator's Notes**, live in your conversations

> **Note:** Some image hosts block direct downloads due to CORS restrictions. SillyTavern's built-in CORS proxy handles this automatically, but it must be enabled. See [Troubleshooting](#media-downloads-fail-with-cors-errors) if downloads fail.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>♻️ Card Updates</h3></summary>

Keep provider-linked characters in sync with their online source:

1. Run **Check for Updates** (single character or batch)
2. Review side-by-side diffs for each field
3. Apply selected fields or apply all in batch

Updates are fetched from the provider's API and only change the fields you choose. Works with all linked providers.

> Review fields carefully before applying. If you manually tag your characters, skip the tags field during sync.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🕓 Version History & Snapshots</h3></summary>

Track changes and restore previous versions of your character cards.

#### Remote Versions (ChubAI)
- View the full published version history from ChubAI's Git API
- Field-by-field diff preview comparing any version to your local card
- Restore any remote version with one click

#### Local Snapshots (All Characters)
- **Save snapshots** of any character's current state at any time
- **Restore, rename, or delete** individual snapshots
- **Auto-backup** before every restore, edit, or card update, with one-click undo
- Auto-backups are deduped and capped at a configurable max (default 10) per character

#### Diff Preview
- Side-by-side comparison for every card field
- **Tags** shown as pill badges with added/removed/kept highlighting
- **Alternate greetings** displayed as numbered expandable blocks with change badges
- **Long text fields** use LCS-based line diff with added/removed highlighting
- Small diffs (≤8 lines) auto-expand for quick review
- Avatar thumbnail with apply button to update the character's image

#### Storage
Snapshots are stored as JSON files via SillyTavern's Files API (`user/files/`), using a per-character file with a master index for fast lookups. Each character gets a stable `version_uid` that travels with the card PNG, so snapshots survive renames and reimports.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🔍 Duplicate Detection</h3></summary>

- **Name similarity** and **creator matching** with fuzzy scoring
- **Creator notes comparison** alongside name, creator, and content fields
- **Jaccard similarity** for content comparison
- **Content divergence penalty** to reduce false positives when name/creator match but card content clearly differs (e.g. male/female character variants)
- **Duplicate media detection** via file hashing
- **Match confidence & reasoning** for each result
- **Exact mode**: Slide the sensitivity to maximum for strict duplicate detection, showing only pairs with identical content across all card fields
- **Playlist integration**: In Exact mode, collect the newest or oldest card from each duplicate group into a playlist for batch cleanup
- **Delete duplicates** directly from the interface with gallery transfer options
- **Pre-import warnings** when downloading potential duplicates

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🏷️ Display Name Override</h3></summary>

Set a per-character display name that overrides the card's original name in the library grid and detail modal. The original name is always preserved in the card data.

- **Per-character override**: Click the name type toggle in the character details header to switch between the card name and your custom display name
- **SillyTavern integration**: Optionally push the display name into SillyTavern's chat and character panel (toggleable in Settings)
- **Search and filter**: Find characters with overrides using the Advanced Filters panel
- **Useful for**: Listing names from providers, translations, personal nicknames, or any scenario where you want a different display name without modifying the card

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🔗 Related Character Discovery</h3></summary>

Automatically finds similar characters via:
- **Shared tags** with rarity weighting (rare tags = stronger signal)
- **Same creator**
- **Content keywords** (shared universes, franchises, themes)

Shows relationship strength and reasoning for each suggestion.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🎲 Card Recommender</h3></summary>

An AI-powered recommendation engine that uses your connected LLM to discover characters from your library based on natural-language prompts.

#### How It Works

1. **Describe what you want.** "Cozy fantasy girls," "dark horror villains," "sci-fi androids with deep lore," etc.
2. Characters are **sampled from your library** and their metadata (name, tags, creator, creator notes, tagline) is sent to your LLM.
3. The model evaluates each character against your prompt and returns a **ranked list with reasons.**
4. Results appear as clickable cards with **expandable reasoning**.
5. Use **Add all to playlist** to save the entire result set to a playlist in one click.
6. **Reroll** to re-run the same prompt with the same settings. Previously picked characters are excluded so each reroll surfaces fresh suggestions from the remaining pool.

#### Batch Mode

For larger libraries, Batch Mode splits your sample pool across multiple parallel batches:

1. **Map phase.** The pool is divided into N batches (configurable, 3-7) and all batches are evaluated simultaneously via parallel API calls.
2. **Reduce phase.** All picks from every batch are collected, deduplicated, and sent to a final ranking pass that selects the best overall matches.
3. Wall-clock time stays roughly the same as a single call thanks to parallelism, but library coverage scales with the batch count (e.g. 5 batches = 5x more characters evaluated).

#### Sample Pool

The Sample Pool controls which characters are eligible for recommendation. Apply pre-sampling filters to narrow the pool, and the "characters in pool" count updates in real time as you adjust them:

- **Has Chats** / **Favorite** tri-state filters (Yes / Any / No)
- **Date Created** range
- **Include / Exclude tags** with autocomplete

If the pool is larger than your configured Sample Size, characters are randomly selected from the filtered pool to fit. For example, with 2,000 characters matching your filters and a sample size of 600, a random subset of 600 is drawn each time you generate.

#### LLM Context

Controls which card metadata fields are included when sending characters to the LLM. Toggle any combination of: tags, creator notes, tagline, creator name, source provider, and description (opt-in, off by default). A live token estimate updates as you change these, helping you stay within model context limits.

#### API Modes

- **SillyTavern mode** uses your active Chat Completion connection (OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, etc.). If you have Connection Profiles configured, a dropdown lets you pick which profile to use. Large, RP heavy presets not recommended.
- **Custom API mode** lets you point to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint with optional API key and model.

#### Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Sample Size | Characters per batch (10-500) |
| Batches | Parallel batch count in Batch Mode (3-7) |
| Temperature | LLM sampling temperature (Custom API only, ST mode uses your preset) |
| Max Results | Maximum recommendations to return |
| LLM Context | Toggle which metadata fields to include (tags, creator notes, tagline, creator, source, opt-in description) with live token estimate |

Access via the **⋮ menu** → **Card Recommender**.

> **Requirements:** Chat Completion APIs only (not Text Completion). The model must be capable of returning structured JSON, so budget/nano models may produce unparseable results. Models like GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash, or equivalent work well.

> **Non-deterministic.** LLMs are inherently probabilistic, so running the same prompt twice may yield different recommendations.

> **Token usage.** Each generation sends your sample pool's metadata to the model. The live token estimate in Settings helps you gauge cost before generating, but it is a rough approximation based on loose averages, not an actual token count. Enabling more context fields (creator notes, tagline) increases token usage per character. In Batch Mode, tokens scale linearly with the batch count, plus a smaller reduce pass.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>💬 Chat History Browser</h3></summary>

- **Browse all conversations** across all characters
- **Sort by** date, character name, message count, chat length, or most active character
- **Group by character** or view flat list
- **Card density presets** (Spacious / Comfortable / Compact / Minimal) to control how much detail each chat card shows
- **AI model badges** showing which model was used for each conversation
- **Message previews** before opening
- **Jump into any chat** without returning to SillyTavern

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>📦 Bundle Export / Import</h3></summary>

Move characters between SillyTavern instances with everything attached, not just the card PNG.

- **Export** via multi-select: pick characters, hit Export, and choose between three modes: a **full bundle** (.zip with cards, all chats, and gallery folders), **character cards** (each card as a separate PNG), or **provider links** (copy the source URLs of linked characters to the clipboard)
- **Include linked lorebooks** toggle adds each character's linked world files to the full bundle
- **Import** by dragging the bundle .zip into the import dialog on the target instance. Cards, chats, gallery folders, and lorebooks are restored, along with metadata that a plain PNG import loses (favorite status, creation date, active chat)
- A progress log reports exactly what was exported or restored, with per-item warnings on failures

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>📖 Lorebook Manager</h3></summary>

A full manager for SillyTavern world files, opened from **More Options (⋮) → Lorebooks**.

- **Browse all lorebooks** with entry counts and a "used by" view showing which characters link each file (primary links) and which chats have it chat-bound
- **Create, import (.json), duplicate, export, and delete** world files
- **Edit entries** inline: keywords, content, insertion settings, per-entry enable/disable
- **AI entry generation**: describe what you want and let the LLM draft lorebook entries
- **Link lorebooks to characters** from the manager or from the character detail modal's Linked Lorebook box, with a playlist filter for bulk linking. This covers the character's primary lorebook; *additional* lorebooks (ST's charLore) are not manageable from here, as they live in SillyTavern's settings with no clean external access
- **Bind lorebooks to chats** (chat lore) from the manager or directly from a chat card in the Chats view; group chats are read-only

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🎨 Custom CSS & AI Assistant</h3></summary>

Theme or tweak the UI with your own CSS, managed as snippets. Open from **Settings → Theme & Layout → Open Custom CSS Editor**.

- **Snippets** can be individually enabled, disabled, renamed, reordered, and deleted; styles persist across reloads
- **AI CSS Assistant**: every snippet row has a wand button that opens a chat-style assistant. Describe the look you want ("dim the card grid", "make the accent purple") and it writes the CSS; iterate with follow-ups and save the result as a new snippet or update the one you started from
- The assistant knows the app's component classes and theme tokens, so its snippets target the real UI instead of guessing selectors
- Class names may change between versions, so treat custom CSS as power-user territory

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🗂️ Unique Gallery Folders</h3></summary>

> ⚠️ **Experimental Feature.** Enable in Settings, Gallery Folders.

#### The Problem
SillyTavern stores gallery images in folders named after the character (e.g., `/user/images/Nami/`). Multiple characters with the same name share the same folder, mixing all their images together.

#### The Solution
Each character gets a **unique gallery folder** using a 12-character ID:
```
/user/images/Nami_aB3xY9kLmN2p/
/user/images/Nami_7Fk2mPqR4sXw/
```

A `gallery_id` is stored in the character's `data.extensions` and SillyTavern's gallery extension is configured to use the unique folder.

#### Migration Tools
- **Assign Gallery IDs** to characters that don't have one
- **Migrate All Images** from old folders to new unique folders (uses content hashing for shared-name disambiguation)
- **Browse Orphaned Folders** to find and redistribute images from legacy folders

#### Disabling
When disabled, you can choose to move images back to default folders, keep them in place, or cancel.

> Gallery IDs in character data are preserved when disabled, so re-enabling uses the same IDs.

<details>
<summary>⚠️ Why Experimental?</summary>

- **Changes ST's default behavior** by overriding how SillyTavern resolves gallery folders
- **Modifies character data** by adding `gallery_id` to character extensions
- **Migration complexity** for large libraries with many same-name characters
- The character card ecosystem has barely enforced standards, so media URLs, CDN behaviors, and creator practices vary wildly

**Back up your ST user folder before enabling this feature.**

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>✅ Gallery Integrity & Sync</h3></summary>

When **Unique Gallery Folders** is enabled, each character's gallery depends on a `gallery_id` stored in the card and a matching folder override registered with SillyTavern. If either gets out of sync (e.g., importing a card directly through SillyTavern, or after a backup restore), images can end up in the wrong folder or become invisible.

- **Status indicator** in the topbar **notifications bell** (shared with background media downloads): the bell switches to a warning icon with a count when characters are missing a `gallery_id`
- **Integrity checks** for missing `gallery_id`s, orphaned mappings, and unregistered overrides
- **Cleanup tools** to assign or remove orphaned mappings safely
- **ST import warning + 1-click fix** when a card is added directly in SillyTavern

</details>

<summary><h3>JanitorAI</h3></summary>

**Auth:** No account needed to browse, but this provider needs a **real browser** to work at all (see below). Sign in for more than the first page of results. Beta, and off by default.

- Browse and search janitorai.com directly, with its own sort orders (Latest, Trending, Trending 24h, Popular, Relevance)
- Filter by tags, NSFW toggle
- In-app character preview with card details, alternate greetings, and lorebook
- **Recovers hidden definitions.** Around half of all JanitorAI characters withhold their definition, and the field is simply absent from the API. Character Library can recover one by letting JanitorAI build a chat prompt and reading it back
- Character linking, card updates, and a Following tab with a followed-creators manager

#### Why it needs a browser

janitorai.com puts Cloudflare in front of everything. Passing that challenge earns a `cf_clearance` cookie that only a real browser can hold, so no server-side request gets through on its own, no matter how it is dressed up.

#### On a normal desktop, it just works

If SillyTavern runs on a Windows or Mac desktop with Chrome or Edge installed (or desktop Linux with Chrome), open **Settings → Online → JanitorAI**, press **Start now**, then **Test**. For most people that is the entire setup: Windows needs nothing extra since Edge counts, the browser runs invisibly, and it stops itself when idle. This needs the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected).

#### The Test button is the contract

The endpoint test runs every check separately and explains each result, because "it failed" is useless when the fix differs per check. **The Cloudflare row is the one that decides**: it measures the challenge itself, which every other row is only predicting. The rendering and WebGL rows are hints shown as warnings, since a software-rendered browser has been measured clearing the challenge and completing an extraction. That makes the support boundary simple:

- **A required check red**: the problem is your browser environment, and getting it green is your side of the contract. The notes below say what helps, and `extras/janitorai-browser/` ships a container that is known to work, but how you produce a passing environment on your own platform is your own research. We do not troubleshoot browser installs, GPU passthrough, Docker, Termux, or distro quirks; there are too many combinations for that to ever work.
- **All checks green and the provider still misbehaves**: that is a Character Library bug, and we genuinely want the report.

#### Servers, VMs, containers, ARM boards: power user territory

Anything that is not a desktop with Chrome or Edge is yours to assemble. Press **Test** instead of reasoning from the machine's specs: Cloudflare's posture changes, and hosts that look unpromising do pass. What helps:

- A Chromium-family binary cl-helper can find: Chrome, Edge, or Chromium, or set `CL_BROWSER` to a path
- H.264 and AAC codecs. This mostly bites Linux ARM: Playwright's arm64 Chromium ships without them, while Debian's `chromium` package and Google's Chrome debs for arm64 both carry them
- A synced system clock
- **Rendering is a hint, not a requirement.** Software rendering sometimes sits on "Just a moment..." and sometimes clears in seconds, so the Cloudflare row is what tells you, not the renderer row. Headless itself is fine

#### If the SillyTavern machine cannot clear Cloudflare

Run the browser on another machine and point Character Library at it. Switch **Settings → Online → JanitorAI → Browser** to **endpoint**, then either:

```bash
# on a desktop
node extras/janitorai-browser/run-browser.mjs
```

```bash
# or in a container, from extras/janitorai-browser/
ADVERTISE_HOST=<that host's LAN ip> docker compose up -d --build
```

Either one prints the URL to paste into the **Browser Endpoint** field. Node 22+, no dependencies, leave it running. `BIND=127.0.0.1` keeps the desktop runner off the LAN. Note this port is **unauthenticated**: anyone who can reach it has full control of that browser and can read its JanitorAI session, so keep it on a network you trust and never port-forward it.

The container is the same script in a Debian image, and it is what runs on the ARM board mentioned above. Expect to adjust it for your host; [`extras/janitorai-browser/README.md`](extras/janitorai-browser/README.md) lists the gotchas that are worth knowing in advance rather than debugging (writable `HOME`, seccomp, shm size, codecs, the profile volume, advertising the right address).

A phone-side browser can also qualify, by exposing its debugging socket through Android's developer facilities, but wiring that up is exactly the kind of setup you research yourself.

#### Signing in

Sign in under **Settings → Online → JanitorAI**, not in the browser itself. Character Library sends that session with each request. Without it JanitorAI serves only the first page of results.

No gallery downloads or version history (JanitorAI doesn't expose these APIs).

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>JannyAI</h3></summary>

**Auth:** No account required, but the companion userscript effectively is: JannyAI now sits behind Cloudflare and without the userscript you cannot get a character's definition or greeting (see below).

A mirror of JanitorAI content. It needs no browser endpoint, which makes it lighter to set up than the first-party JanitorAI provider above, but it serves no alternate greetings and has no following.

- Browse and search the JannyAI character catalog
- Filter by tags, token count, NSFW toggle
- In-app character preview with card details
- Character linking and card updates

No gallery downloads, version history, or alternate greetings.

#### Cloudflare and the userscript

JannyAI Cloudflare-gates its card pages, and the card page is where the character actually lives. Browsing and searching still work without anything extra, but an import without the userscript gets you the name, avatar, tags, and the site blurb as creator's notes, with no description, no greeting, no scenario, and no example dialogue. That is a stub, not a character. Treat the userscript as required:

1. Install a userscript manager (Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey)
2. Add `extras/cl-janitor-bridge.user.js` from this repository
3. Reload the Character Library tab

The userscript makes the gated request from your own browser and hands back only the result. The DataCat provider uses the same userscript for its Hampter sorts, so one install covers both. It has nothing to do with the JanitorAI provider, which uses a real browser instead. If definitions stop loading even with it installed, your Cloudflare pass has probably expired: open jannyai.com in the same browser, let it load, then reopen the preview.

- Browse and search the Wyvern character catalog
- Discovery-focused sorting: popularity, recommended, newest, most likes, and most messages
- Filter by tags and NSFW state
- In-app character preview before import
- Gallery downloads from linked Wyvern characters

#### With Authentication

- **Follow/Unfollow users** directly from the preview modal

#### Character Library Integration
- **Link local cards to Wyvern** for update checks and sync
- **Auto-link on import** when importing directly from Wyvern

#### Login
1. When you enable NSFW or access a login-required feature, a login modal will appear
2. Enter your Wyvern email and password (or set them in Settings)
3. *(Optional)* Check "Remember credentials" for auto-refresh

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>DataCat (Experimental)</h3></summary>

**Auth:** Browsing uses an anonymous session created by **cl-helper 1.13.1 or newer**. Datacat can require human verification before exporting a card; that happens in your browser on Datacat.

> **Experimental and disabled by default.** Enable it in Settings > Online > Providers. Existing provider preferences and card links are preserved when updating.

- Browse and search Datacat's JanitorAI, Saucepan, and native Datacat characters, with recent and Fresh feeds, tags, creator catalogs, and following.
- Preview a character and choose **Source** or **Reimagination**. Source is the default; Reimagination is Datacat's AI-generated alternative and is available only when Datacat provides it. CharacterLibrary remembers the choice for linked-card updates and never silently substitutes another definition.
- Import cards with their exported greetings, notes, lorebooks, extensions, and artwork. Current source-qualified Datacat URLs and older character links both work.
- Retrieve missing JanitorAI or Saucepan characters, and optionally request fresh retrieval before update comparisons. Availability depends on Datacat's service and creator settings. Native Datacat uploads are not sent to external retrieval services.
- JanitorAI MeiliSearch and Hampter sort modes remain available. Hampter sorts use the separate JanitorAI bridge described below.

#### Setup and upgrading

1. Install or update the bundled **cl-helper to 1.13.1**, then **restart SillyTavern**. Updating the extension alone does not reload a running server plugin. Settings > Info shows the helper's running version and update controls.
2. Enable DataCat in Settings > Online > Providers. Its browsing session initializes automatically.
3. For downloads that request verification, install or update [the Datacat Export Companion to 1.0.2](extras/cl-datacat-bridge.user.js) in Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey on the browser where you use CharacterLibrary. Allow it on datacat.run, including frames. It needs page-context execution to call Datacat's export tools.
4. Click Import or check a single linked card for updates. When the Datacat panel opens, click **Export to Character Library** inside it and complete Datacat's verification. The companion passes your selected Source/Reimagination choice to Datacat's own export function and returns the PNG card. Datacat account credentials stay on Datacat.
5. If the panel reports that the companion is missing, install/enable it and click **Reload**. Close or Cancel stops the pending export without replacing a local card. Browsers that block embedded Datacat or do not support userscripts cannot complete this optional verified-export flow.

User-started bulk imports reuse one panel and export characters serially. Batch update scans never open verification panels: a gated card is labeled **Verification required** and skipped; use a single-card update check to complete verification and compare it.

The helper session and the embedded Datacat browser session are separate. Verifying an export in the browser does not unlock the helper's downloads or share a login token with CharacterLibrary. Creator download restrictions and redirects are reported instead of falling back to a reconstructed card.

CharacterLibrary **7.3.3** also recognizes current Recent/Mine/Basket links and refuses an unavailable saved definition or variant. If Datacat removed the selected version, open the preview and explicitly choose an available one before importing or updating. Authentication, browser verification, creator restrictions, missing cards, and service failures stay distinct; a generic authentication failure does not replace an existing session. See the [validation record](tests/datacat/README.md) for automated coverage and live-test limitations.

#### Retrieval

Paste a JanitorAI or Saucepan URL to look up its character. A genuinely missing character offers **Retrieve**; session errors and temporary outages are reported separately. Once Datacat completes the matching retrieval request, the character becomes available for preview and export. Enable **Publish retrieved characters on DataCat** only when you want your requested public-feed visibility set to public. Reimagination selection downloads an existing alternative; it does not request generation or repair.

#### JanitorAI Hampter sorts

Latest, Trending, Trending 24h, Popular, and Relevance use JanitorAI's Cloudflare-protected endpoints. Install [the JanitorAI Bridge](extras/cl-janitor-bridge.user.js) for those sorts. To page past JanitorAI's anonymous limit, add your JanitorAI session under Settings > Online > DataCat. This is a **different script** from the Datacat Export Companion; the two scripts serve separate purposes. Other Datacat and MeiliSearch sort orders need no userscript.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Botbooru</h3></summary>

**Auth:** Optional username/password login. The login handshake goes through the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected); without the plugin you can paste an API token manually instead. Anonymous browsing is **SFW-only**: the server filters NSFW regardless of client settings.

- Browse and search the Botbooru card catalog (tag-driven: include tags, exclude with `-tag`)
- Sort by latest, curated, or random, plus a full popularity matrix: most favorited, most viewed, and most downloaded, each over day, week, month, or all time
- **Curated extras**: a **New uploads only** toggle excludes bumped/updated cards from the Curated feed; weighted-tag accounts also pick between Recent, Tag Score, and Only Followed orderings
- **Advanced Options** (Tags dropdown): a **Min Tokens** threshold with an optional **Count lorebook tokens** switch, plus an uploaded after/before date range
- **Hide AI-generated** content filter (Features dropdown)
- In-app character preview with card details and tag list
- Imports the full V2 card (PNG with embedded data, JSON also available)
- Character linking and card updates
- Gallery downloads from linked Botbooru posts
- **Writer credit on cards**: the Writer tag is shown as the creator; the uploader has its own entry point to browse everything they've posted

#### With Authentication
- **NSFW browsing** - Character Library syncs your account's NSFW visibility switches automatically the first time you enable the NSFW toggle (a separate NSFL checkbox is available; NSFL cards carry their own badge, distinct from NSFW)
- **Following timeline** built from uploaders you follow (follow by profile URL or numeric user id), with its own sort options (newest, oldest, name, favorites, views, downloads, random); uploader banners reflect your account's live follow state
- **Post favorites** (heart) synced with your account
- **Favorite tags** - starred tags act as boosters for the Curated sort and are stored on your account, manageable from Settings > Online > Botbooru (the tag inputs autocomplete from Botbooru's tag list; a `category:` prefix like `char:` narrows matches)
- **Weighted tag mode (experimental)** - account-side switch in Settings > Online > Botbooru that replaces the simple favorite-tags list with per-tag weights (-1000 to 1000) plus always-follow / always-block flags, and unlocks the extra Curated orderings. While it's on, the site ignores the simple list (Character Library disables it with a warning) and the browse Tags-dropdown stars manage weight entries (+100) instead
- Your account's tag blacklist applies server-side to browse results

#### Login
1. When you enable NSFW or use a login-required feature, the login modal appears (also reachable from the filter bar's account button)
2. Enter your Botbooru username and password (requires the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected))
3. Without the plugin, paste a token manually in the same modal; tokens are long-lived (~90 days) and a copied `Bearer ` prefix is stripped automatically

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Saucepan</h3></summary>

**Auth:** Browsing needs no account, importing does. Requires the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected) for everything, including browsing. Beta, and off by default.

- Browse and search saucepan.ai, sorted by New, Trending, or Popular
- Filter by tags, NSFW toggle, and by **fandom**, a separate dimension from tags covering source material and franchise
- **Creator mode** for browsing one creator's companions, sorted by message count or age
- In-app character preview with card details
- Character linking and card updates

Definitions are extracted natively rather than downloaded as a card file. Some companions have a locked definition that is not publicly available, and the preview says so; extraction may return an incomplete character body for those.

#### Login
1. Install the [cl-helper plugin](#cl-helper-plugin-not-detected). Saucepan sends no CORS headers at all, so every request goes through it, browsing included
2. Go to **Settings → Online → Saucepan** and log in, or paste a bearer token from your own Saucepan session

Opening a character that needs authentication turns the preview's import button into **Configure Token**, which takes you to the same place.

The token is held in memory by cl-helper and pushed back to it automatically after a SillyTavern restart, so you should not need to log in again.

</details>

### Character Linking

Link your local characters to their online source for updates, gallery downloads, and version history:

- **Manual linking** via the provider indicator in character details
- **Bulk link scanner** to auto-match unlinked characters (accessible from the ⋮ menu)
- **Auto-link on import** for characters downloaded from any provider
- **View on provider** to jump to the source site or open an in-app preview

### Batch Import

- Paste multiple URLs from any supported provider (one per line)
- **Direct URL downloads**: check **Import unrecognized URLs as direct downloads** (URL mode) to fetch links that don't match any provider as plain PNG cards. Catbox, Discord CDN, and raw GitHub links work out of the box; allow other hosts via `whitelistImportDomains` in SillyTavern's `config.yaml`. Downloaded cards ride the normal import pipeline: duplicate check, provider auto-link, and the auto-download options
- Drag & drop or browse local PNG character card files
- Progress tracking and error logging
- Pre-import duplicate detection
- **Auto-download options** to download gallery and embedded media during import

## 📱 Mobile

The full app is optimized for mobile with:

- **Touch-optimized** tap targets and swipe gestures throughout
- **View swipe**: swipe left/right on the main screen to switch between Characters, Chats, and Online views
- **Tab swipe**: swipe left/right on character detail tabs to navigate between them
- **Greetings swipe**: swipe left/right to cycle alternate greetings
- **Card swipe gestures**: swipe right on a card to toggle favorite, swipe left to open the context menu. Card swipes are suppressed in the outer 12% of each card and the bottom 25%, so view-swipe and tab-swipe gestures starting near card edges aren't hijacked. Toggle the whole feature in Settings if you find swipes triggering accidentally
- **Prev/Next character navigation**: swipe left/right on the character detail modal header to step through the current sort + filter view (toggleable in Settings)
- **Mobile search overlay**: bottom-pinned and keyboard-aware. The search box opens above the bottom nav when the keyboard is closed, and lifts above the keyboard when it opens, so the whole flow stays in the thumb zone
- **Title scroll-reveal**: tap a long character name in the modal header, or a long chat title in the chat preview header, to scroll through the full text
- **Bottom sheets** for context menus, tag editor, filters, settings, and confirm dialogs (replacing desktop dropdowns)
- **Full-viewport modals** for character details and previews
- **Top-bias face crop** on avatar thumbs across chat list rows, group composites, message bubbles, and the mobile detail-modal header thumb, so faces survive the circular and square crops
- **Gallery viewer** with pinch / scroll-wheel zoom, drag pan, and swipe navigation
- **Haptic feedback** on swipe actions, toggles, and destructive confirms (requires device support)
- **Back button handling** for modal navigation: Android back closes the top overlay in tier order before exiting the app

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### cl-helper plugin not detected

**cl-helper** is Character Library's companion plugin. It runs inside the SillyTavern server and handles the few things a browser tab cannot do on its own (login handshakes, cookie sessions, cached thumbnails). If the app sent you here, the feature you just tried needs it. The plugin ships with Character Library in the `extras/cl-helper/` folder; installing it is one copy plus one config line.

**One-command install (Linux, macOS, Termux):** open a terminal (in Termux, the same one you start SillyTavern from), then run:

```bash
bash "$(find ~ -maxdepth 8 -type d -name SillyTavern-CharacterLibrary 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)/extras/install-cl-helper.sh"
```

Or, if you know where the extension folder is, just run `bash <extension folder>/extras/install-cl-helper.sh` directly. The script copies the plugin into place, enables `enableServerPlugins` in config.yaml, and tells you what it did. When it finishes, **restart SillyTavern** and reload the Character Library tab. On Windows, use the manual steps below instead.

**Manual install:**

1. Copy (or symlink) the `extras/cl-helper` folder into your SillyTavern **plugins** directory:
   ```
   SillyTavern/plugins/cl-helper/
   ```
2. Open your SillyTavern **config.yaml** (in your ST root folder) and set `enableServerPlugins` to `true`:
   ```yaml
   enableServerPlugins: true
   ```
3. **Restart SillyTavern** (plugins only load at startup)
4. Reload the Character Library tab and open **Settings → Info**: the cl-helper section should show the running version with a green check

> The plugin only talks to the specific provider APIs through hostname-pinned, path-allowlisted proxies; most are read-only GET proxies, plus a handful of dedicated POST routes for login handshakes and extraction. See the [plugin source](extras/cl-helper/index.js) for details.

### Media downloads fail with CORS errors

Some image hosts (Imgur, Catbox, etc.) block direct browser requests due to CORS restrictions. Character Library automatically falls back to SillyTavern's built-in CORS proxy, but it must be enabled. This is a server-side setting; there is no toggle for it in SillyTavern's UI:

1. Open `config.yaml` in your SillyTavern root folder
2. Set `enableCorsProxy: true`
3. Restart the SillyTavern server
4. Retry the download in Character Library

This affects embedded media downloads, provider gallery downloads, bulk localization, and provider browsing (CharacterTavern in particular can only be reached through the proxy).

### A provider grid fails to load ("Search failed", error banner)

When a browse grid fails, the error banner explains the cause and offers **Retry** plus a **Copy error report** button. When asking for help (Discord, GitHub), click Copy error report and paste the result; it contains the exact failure, response details, and the relevant settings as on/off flags (never your tokens). Common messages:

- **"CORS proxy is disabled. Set enableCorsProxy: true..."**: SillyTavern ships with its CORS proxy off. Follow the steps in the section above.
- **"Cloudflare blocked this request from your SillyTavern server"**: the provider's Cloudflare rejected the request coming from your ST server. Common when ST runs on a VPS or behind a VPN (datacenter IPs get blocked), or during bulk operations (rate rules); waiting a few minutes usually clears the rate case.
- **"Your SillyTavern server could not reach \<site\>"**: your browser is fine, but the ST server itself has no route to the provider (server-side network, DNS, or VPN problem). Remember the browser's connection and the server's connection are separate things. (Rarely, a provider outage that returns a bare 500 looks identical; if other providers load fine from the same server, suspect that provider instead.)
- **"Could not reach your SillyTavern server"**: the ST server is down or your connection to it dropped.
- **"The provider returned an error page instead of data"**: something between your ST server and the provider intercepted the request and answered with a web page (ISP block page, captive portal, gateway login). The error report's body snippet shows the start of that page, which usually identifies the culprit.

Older versions surfaced these as raw parser noise like "Search failed: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data"; if you see that exact message, update Character Library and retry for a readable error.

### DataCat: JanitorAI Hampter sorts say "Cloudflare blocked this request"

JanitorAI's Hampter sort orders (Latest, Trending, and the rest, on the DataCat provider) sit behind Cloudflare bot protection. A direct load usually gets blocked (it occasionally slips through, but you can't rely on it). Install the companion userscript for dependable access:

1. Install a userscript manager (Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey)
2. Add `extras/cl-janitor-bridge.user.js` from this repository
3. Reload the Character Library tab and retry the sort

The userscript makes the Cloudflare-gated request from your own browser and hands only the results to Character Library. Without it these sorts are unreliable (Cloudflare usually blocks the direct fetch, though it occasionally gets through); every other DataCat and JannyAI sort order works without it. To page past the first page, also add your JanitorAI login under Settings > Online > DataCat. Tested on desktop; on mobile, a userscript-capable browser such as Firefox for Android, or a mobile-specific solution that routes the request through a webview, works too.

The userscript serves exactly two things: these DataCat Hampter sorts, and **JannyAI** card definitions. The **JanitorAI** provider never uses it. That provider needs a real browser, which Character Library runs for you, and no userscript can substitute for it.

### Characters load more slowly behind HTTP Basic auth

If SillyTavern is behind HTTP Basic authentication (ST's `basicAuthMode`, or an upstream reverse proxy that asks for a username and password), loading a character's heavy data can be noticeably slower than on an instance without it.

To keep memory low on large libraries, Character Library holds only lightweight data in memory and fetches each character's full content (description, greetings, embedded lorebook, etc.) on demand, one request per character. Basic auth adds overhead to each request, so it is paid on every per-character load: the detail view opens instantly but its text fills in a moment later, and update or version checks run slower. The character grid loads in one bulk request and is unaffected. This happens regardless of ST's `lazyLoadCharacters` setting (it comes from Character Library's own memory optimization, not ST shallow loading); enabling ST lazy loading only makes it more noticeable.

The delay is in how Basic auth is handled per request between your browser and SillyTavern, not processing time in either, so there is no extension setting to speed it up. If it is bothersome, reach SillyTavern over a trusted local network or a tunnel/VPN that authenticates the connection rather than each HTTP request.

---

### Reminder: Online features depend on services we don't control

Anything in Character Library that reaches an external service rides on third-party APIs we neither own nor control: the online provider browsers (ChubAI, JanitorAI, CharacterTavern, Pygmalion, Wyvern, DataCat, Botbooru) and their imports, plus embedded media and gallery downloads. Those services change without warning. Endpoints get renamed or removed, response shapes shift, access is tightened, rate limits change, and Cloudflare-style protections start challenging automated requests. When one of them changes, the feature that relied on it can break or start misbehaving, and there is frequently nothing the extension can do from its side until the new behavior is understood.

We treat these as bugs and fix them as they come, but this kind of breakage is inevitable over time and largely outside our hands. The fastest path to a fix is a report. If a provider stops working or starts acting strangely, please open an issue describing what you did and what happened.

## Contributing

Right now this project isn't really set up to take contributions. Development happens outside GitHub and this repo is a release mirror, so pull requests aren't the main path. The bigger problem is that a lot of what makes this codebase work isn't written down anywhere. The conventions, the invariants, the reasons things are shaped the way they are, most of that only exists in my head. That's on me to fix, and until I do, contributing here is harder than it should be.

Issues are a different story and they're genuinely welcome. Bug reports, provider breakage, feature ideas, all of it helps, and it costs you a lot less than a patch that turns out not to fit.

If you do want to write code, open an issue first and say what you're planning. What usually sinks a patch isn't the feature, it's the dozen other places that have to change with it. That's the part the missing docs would have warned you about.

I'd rather be upfront about the bar than have you run into it in review. I take this project seriously, and code that mostly works isn't good enough. Two things especially:

- **Know where the code came from.** Anything borrowed from another project needs a license compatible with AGPL-3.0. A repo with no license file isn't permissive by default, it's all rights reserved. If part of what you send came from somewhere else, just say so and link it. That's normal, and a lot easier than it coming out later.
- **Send code you understand and have run.** I use assistants here too, so this isn't a rule against them. The bar is the same either way. Expect to be asked why something is shaped the way it is, and to have run the feature end to end first, including the empty, expired and failure states. Code that reads well but has only been down the happy path takes the longest to review.

None of this is meant to put you off. It's meant to stop you sinking real time into something I'd then have to turn down. If you're serious about it, I'd genuinely like to see it.
